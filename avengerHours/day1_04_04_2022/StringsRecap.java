    String -> object type class. Sequence of chars.
    string class is a member of java.lang package. no need to import.
    There are 2 ways to create a string object;
    1 - String literal (mostly used) - String str - "Apple";
    created in string pool in heap memory

    2 - new keyword - String str2 - new String ("Apple");
    created in heap directly
    **both are same in terms of usage, but only differs foe memory allocation.

   String objects are immutable which means unmodifiable/unchangeable.

   String a = "apple"; // a new obh created in str pool in heap
   a = "Apple"; // a new obj is created in str pool in heap, not modified from the former version
