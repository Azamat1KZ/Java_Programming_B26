    /*
    Main point: Data hiding - Protect data - Security of data

    how can we perform encapsulation?
    - make instance variables private
    - create a PUBLIC Getter
    - create a PUBLIC Setter

    Benefits

    - protect out data from invalid input / values
    - use conditions for setter method to verify our data same with requested format

    Ex: Strong password -< Lowercase / uppercase / Numbers etc

    - Customize getter method to return our data in certain format

    Ex:  decoding password

    12345 --> Encrypt --> ABCDE ---> Decoding --> 12345

    Do we need to use both (setter | const) in same class?
    - Yes. They have slight difference

    Constr --> It will run ONCE when Object is created
    Setter --> To update the value of instance variable

    What is boiler plate?
